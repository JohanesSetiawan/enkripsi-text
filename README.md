# enkripsi_text

Flutter project to encryption text using algoritm... uhm... it's called: simple *ehe*

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

## How about Algorithm?
uhh... i can't say that, go check code.

## Problems and Bugs?
- decrypting text is most hard to code, because i don't know the encrypt and decrypt algorithm (it's done) *thanks chatGPT to help create code.*

## Feature?
- input plain text, and botton to click encrypt.
- add history encrypt and decrypt.
- floating button to decrypt.
- copy to clipboard.

## Conclusion?
idk, just random project, and i like it to create this. Oh sorry about messy code.
